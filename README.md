# 3d-in-pygame

NOTE: I am the only contributor on this project, the other account ended up here by me entering an invalid email in one of the commits. I have rebased the entire project after I that but account still there. I give it some days, it could be a cache issue.

I do want to give credit to https://github.com/davidpendergast/pygame-utils because my WarpableSurface class was build upon its warp-method.
